# Taskzilla

**Taskzilla** is a Telegram bot for managing tasks and projects

- Tasks can belong to a certain project or be addresses as  _'general'_, which means that they do not belong to any project

## To fix in future

- Right now creating projects with name **"General"** is forbidden since _General_ is a default project that is created when a user starts the bot for the first time
